# Where things stand

Hub repository for the Maya Dates project, per ADR 0010 (supersedes 0007).
Holds all project issues (epic → story → task, per ADR 0009), decisions,
research findings, the product spec, work plans, and the eight project skills
served as the `maya` Claude Code plugin from this repo's marketplace. The
fixture dataset itself lives in `maya-date-fixtures` (ADR 0006).

## Status

Architecture partly ratified, product specified, work planned; no fixtures written yet.

- ADRs 0001, 0002 and 0006 are `accepted` (2026-09-13). 0001 was amended during
  acceptance: layer 2 is `@drewsonne/maya-date-operations`, not
  `@drewsonne/maya-calculator`. ADRs 0003, 0004, 0005, 0007 and 0008 remain `proposed`.
- Product spec and maintenance backlog live in `docs/product/` (from the maya-spec
  interview, 2026-09-13).
- The fixtures-first plan (`docs/plan/2026-09-13-fixtures-first.md`) is decomposed into
  9 GitHub issues across 4 waves, transferred to `maya-project` (ADR 0010), all on the project board.

Repository facts are re-verified rather than carried forward — see
`docs/research/repository-state.md`, checked 2026-09-13.

## Next

1. Accept or amend the remaining ADRs: 0003, 0004, 0005, 0008 (0007 superseded by 0010).
2. Create the layer-2 repository (`@drewsonne/maya-date-operations`) — blocks 0004.
3. Land the three PRs kept after the 2026-09-14 triage (31 closed): parser #30
   (maya-dates ^1.3.0 + barrel exports; Node 24.x check failing), #15 (public parse
   API, no CI ever ran — needs local tests and review, relates to ADR 0003), and #29
   (EBNF grammar, maintenance). One consolidated dependency pass after #30 replaces
   the closed bumps. `maya-calculator` and `maya-dates` are clear.
4. ~~Start wave 1~~ Done 2026-09-20: `wave-1-schema-ci` merged
   (maya-date-fixtures#10), task #1 and story #11 closed, epic #10 at 1/4.
   Next wave of work: the six wave-2 fixture issues (#2–#7, story #12).

## Open questions

- Does `@drewsonne/maya-dates` accept out-of-range Long Count positions the way the app
  does? Unverified. Settle by differential test, not assumption. (ADR 0005; issue #9
  exists to answer this with evidence.)
- Does `CommentWrapper` belong in layer 1 or layer 2? Unresolved. (ADR 0004)
- Layer 1 value objects declare no `readonly` fields, so immutability is unasserted. (ADR 0001)
- Spanish renderings of Calendar Round, Distance Number and Lord of the Night need
  sourcing against Kettunen & Helmke. *Cuenta Larga* is confirmed. (ADR 0008)
- Release/versioning tooling and app deployment now that Travis is dead. No ADR yet.
