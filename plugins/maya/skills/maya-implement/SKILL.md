description: Craft rules for writing code in the Maya date project — fixtures first, layer discipline, test and commit conventions. Use when implementing a work package or making any change to calendar logic, and hand it to every dispatched agent.

# Implement a change

How work gets done here. Every agent dispatched by `maya-fleet` receives this, and so does any change made by hand. Without it each contributor invents its own conventions and the codebase drifts in six directions at once.

## Order of work

Never write implementation first.

1. **Read the package block** — goal, scope, contract, criteria, fixtures. If any acceptance criterion is ambiguous, stop and report it. Do not interpret an ambiguous criterion; an agent that guesses produces something that passes its own reading and fails the real one.
2. **Run the existing suite.** If it is already failing, stop and report that. Never start work on a red baseline — you will not be able to tell what you broke.
3. **Write or confirm the failing test first**, from the fixtures named in the package. Watch it fail for the right reason. A test that passes before you have implemented anything is testing nothing.
4. **Implement the smallest change that makes it pass.**
5. **Run the full suite**, not just your test.
6. **Re-read the acceptance criteria** and check each one explicitly, by name.

## Absolute rules

- **Never modify a fixture file, an expected value, or a spec's assertion to make a test pass.** If a fixture disagrees with your implementation, the fixture wins and your work is blocked — report the disagreement, do not resolve it. On a calendar tool, an expected date edited to get green is a bug shipped with a passing test attached to it, which is worse than no test at all.
- **Never modify anything listed in your package's contract.** Exported signatures, other layers, other packages.
- **Modify only paths matching your declared scope.** If the change genuinely requires touching something outside it, stop and report; do not widen your own scope.
- **Dependencies point inward only**: presentation → parsing → operations → representation. Never add an import from a lower layer to a higher one. If you need something from above, the design is wrong — report it.

## Calendar logic in particular

This is where the project's value and its risk both sit.

- Any change to Long Count, Calendar Round, Tzolk'in, Haab, day-number or correlation-constant arithmetic requires fixture coverage first. If none exists, stop: the package should have depended on a fixture package.
- Prefer direct arithmetic to progressive subtraction. `Math.floor(n / 20) % 18` is verifiable by inspection; `(total - this.total()) / 20 % 18` is not, and the second form is a known source of error in this codebase.
- Winal is base-18. Every other position is base-20. Write it explicitly rather than relying on a shared constant that hides the exception.
- Never silently normalise out-of-range input inside a function that is documented as strict, or raise inside one documented as lenient. If the intended behaviour is unclear, it is an open question for `maya-record`, not a judgement call.

## Conventions

- TypeScript packages: specs live beside their source as `*.spec.ts`, or under `src/__tests__/`. Run with `mocha -r ts-node/register 'src/**/*.spec.ts'`. Assertions use chai. Coverage via `nyc`.
- The legacy app uses jest until it is migrated.
- Value objects in the representation layer are immutable. Declare fields `readonly`; do not add setters.
- Import from package roots, never deep paths (`@drewsonne/maya-dates`, not `@drewsonne/maya-dates/lib/lc/long-count`).
- Public API changes are semver events. Removing or changing an export is a major bump and needs an ADR, not a commit message.
- Code comments and commit messages are English, whatever the documentation policy says about prose.

## Commits and pull requests

- Conventional prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`.
- One logical change per commit. A commit that both moves code and changes behaviour cannot be reviewed or reverted — split it.
- Reference the package id and issue number in the body. Issues live on the hub (ADR 0009): from a satellite repo, close the task with the full cross-repo form `Closes drewsonne/maya-project#N` — a bare `Closes #N` there closes nothing.
- Open a **draft** pull request. Never merge, never push to `main`.
- The PR description states: the package id, which acceptance criteria are met, which fixtures now pass, and anything you were blocked on. Do not describe the diff — it is visible.

## When to stop

Stop and report, rather than pressing on, if: the baseline suite is red, a fixture disagrees with your implementation, an acceptance criterion is ambiguous, the change needs to escape its scope or contract, or the work reveals a decision nobody has made. Each of those is a finding worth more than a completed package built on a guess.
